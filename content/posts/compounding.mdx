## Who is Buddha?

Have you ever wondered how ancient wisdom can illuminate our modern lives? Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, offers just that. Buddhism is a philosophy or religion, that guides us towards enduring happiness and away from suffering. This journey is not just about spiritual awakening; it's about practical choices that impact our daily lives.

Buddhism at its core aims to liberate us from suffering. Different people choose different ways to gain happiness:

- Some might seek immediate joy, like having many sweets, which offers brief pleasure but could lead to health issues and subsequent suffering.
- Others might choose a consistently healthy diet, enduring initial discomfort from less tasty foods, in pursuit of long-term happiness through better health.

The essence of Buddhism is about cultivating the ultimate wisdom to find happiness at all times, under any circumstances, and with anyone.

The ultimate wisdom is called 'emptiness'—a principle asserting that everything is interconnected and lacks independent existence.

It's not that easy to understand this concept, there are many books in Buddhism trying to teach this concept, I will try to make it simple and hopefully it is helpful for your understanding.

## The Interconnectedness of All Things

"Everything is interconnected and lacks independent existence." To understand this, consider the compounding nature of everything:

Everything is a compound of other elements.

Take a moment to think about any object or concept. Is it made up of other components?

A table, for instance, is crafted from wood, sourced from trees, which in turn, grew from seeds nurtured by soil and water. The interconnectedness is evident, showing that a table doesn't exist in isolation.

Consider a more abstract example: a husband’s identity is made up of his wife. Without her, the identity of 'husband' doesn't exist.

This interconnectedness is not limited to physical objects but includes phenomena and personal traits. Qualities we admire or despise in ourselves and others, such as self-discipline or excessive gaming, often result from external influences.

So, before being too hard on yourself or others, remember that many factors shaping our behaviors are not entirely within our control, we are made up of too many things. However, this doesn't mean you should give up on yourself or others, there are many things that you can do, to make some causes and conditions happen, leading positive change.

**Try your best, and also accept any outcome.**

This is the wisdom you can get after understanding the compounding nature of everything.

If you divide enough times, you will find that everything is interconnected, and lacks self existence, cause they are just made up of other things! This is emptiness.

Remind yourself of emptiness when you are very happy or very sad, I believe that it will guide you to the middle way, not too happy, and not too sad, a state of enlightment.

## Wrapping Up

- Everything is a compound of other elements.
- Many characteristics (good or bad) seen in ourselves and others are shaped by factors beyond our control.
  - This realization fosters empathy and patience.
- Grasping the compounding nature of things is a significant step towards understanding emptiness.
